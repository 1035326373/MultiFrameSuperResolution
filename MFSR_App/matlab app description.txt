You can choose from multiple image registration and super-resolution algorithms to compute an image of higher resolution.
Image registration methods: MATLAB image Registration, Lucas-Kanade gradient based algorithm for affine transformation ore solely translatory registration.
Super-resolution methods: Adaptive Kernel Regression method by Islam et al. (not recommended), Cubic Spline Interpolation Method, Robust and Fast Robust Super Resolution algorithms proposed by Sina Farsiu et al.
